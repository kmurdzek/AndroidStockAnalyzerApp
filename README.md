# AndroidStockAnalyzerApp
The Stock Analyzer App is an Android app written in Java that uses the Yahoo Finance API to get the current trending stocks as well as their key ratios. Users are also able to check their favorite stocks by typing in the stocks ticker symbol in the search bar. The process in which the application displays its data is as follows. Upon the user clicking the “Retrieve Trending Stock” button, a list of the days trending stocks are generated in a list, the user is capable of scrolling through the list and clicking any of the stocks to see their key financial ratios as well as analysts recommendations and predictions. The user can also type in a stock ticker to see the ratios and recommendations for a stock of their choice. Once the screen of the stock appears you must click the “Show Data” button to see the key ratios and analyst recommendations for the stock.
